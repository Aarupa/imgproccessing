# Image Processing with OpenCV

This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates basic image processing using the OpenCV library. The script loads an image from a file, displays it in a window, waits for a specified duration, and then closes the window.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python and the OpenCV library installed on your machine.

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

### Running the Code

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have an image file (e.g., "pic1.jpeg") that you want to process.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository's directory.

4. Run the following command to execute the script:

   ```bash
   python image_processing.py
   ```

## Code Explanation

The script (`image_processing.py`) performs the following steps:

1. Import the OpenCV library.

2. Load an image from a file.

3. Display the image in a window.

4. Wait for a specified duration (10 seconds) and then close the window.
